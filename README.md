## 🚀 AI-Augmented Prototyping

I specialize in **Rapid Prototyping** and **DevOps**, leveraging AI as a force multiplier to build, deploy, and scale systems in record time. My workflow bridges the gap between high-level AI orchestration and low-level systems engineering.

- **Speed-to-Production**: Turning concepts into working MVPs using modern AI-driven development stacks.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Automating deployments and managing complex environments.
- **Systems Rigor**: Applying the "Piscine" mindset to modern software challenges.

## 🛰️ Core Projects & Research

### **OpenSpore** | *Autonomous Agent Orchestration*
*Researching how to build self-correcting, autonomous swarms.*
- Built with **Rust** for safety and near-native performance.
- Implements parallel tool execution and hierarchical task management.
- Designed as a lightweight engine for autonomous technical tasks.

### **Mycelium Extension** | *Knowledge Management for Developers*
*Optimizing the developer's second brain with AI.*
- Socratic journaling interface for documenting complex technical decisions.
- Knowledge graph visualization for discovering hidden patterns in large codebases.

## ⚔️ Technical Bedrock: 42 Paris

My foundation is built at **Ecole 42 Paris**, where everything is learned from the ground up without high-level abstractions.

- **Systems**: `minishell` (Shell in C), `ft_irc` (IRC in C++), `Philosophers` (Concurrency).
- **DevOps**: `Inception` (Docker infrastructure/virtualization), `ft_server`.
- **Optimization**: `push_swap` (Sorting logic), `libft`.
