## 🚀 AI-Augmented Prototyping

I specialize in **Rapid Prototyping** and **DevOps**, leveraging AI as a force multiplier to build, deploy, and scale systems in record time. My workflow bridges the gap between high-level AI orchestration and low-level systems engineering.

- **Speed-to-Production**: Turning concepts into working MVPs using modern AI-driven development stacks.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Automating deployments and managing complex environments.
- **Systems Rigor**: Applying the "Piscine" mindset to modern software challenges.

## ⚔️ Technical Bedrock: 42 Paris

My foundation is built at **Ecole 42 Paris**, where I mastered the duality of software engineering: building from the ground up without abstractions, while architecting complex, high-level systems.

> **$ ls -t projects/**
> `libft` • `ft_printf` • `get_next_line` • `born2beroot` • `fract'ol` • `push_swap` • `pipex` • `Philosophers` • **`minishell`** • `cub3d` • `netpractice` • `cpp_modules` • **`ft_irc`** • **`Inception`** • **`ft_transcendence`**

*From micro-optimizing C logic to deploying multi-service Docker infrastructures.*
